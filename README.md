//Project Overview:
+Based on Alex's Figma demo, create a simple UI where the doctor takes notes from a conversation with a patient. 
+Pressing on the "Dictation" button next to Patient info will allow the doctor to record the conversation
+Currently, I am able to use the library speech_to_text to translate the recording to text and display it in Dication notes.
+I still have not been able to send the recording stream to AWS yet.
+The stop recording works but is still a little bit messy.
